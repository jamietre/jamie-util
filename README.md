# Jamie's Utils

## What is this

Largely AI-built tools to automate some things I do. 

- [Photo Sync](./photo-sync/README.md) - synchronize my android phone's photos to a local archive, organized by date
- [Ingest Music](./ingest-music/README.md) - add live music into my permanent library using consistent tagging & naming

## What platform is this for

Should work on anything that can run node.js. I'm running this on Ubuntu in WSL2 on windows, but can't think why it wouldn't work on anything else. 

## What state is it in 

It's in the "works for me" state. I add features and fix bugs almost every time I use it.

## Should I use this

If it seems useful, give it a shot

## Will you answer questions

Maybe

## Will you accept pull requests

Probably not

## Will anything here be released/published

Unlikely. What's the point when AI can build something tailored to you so easily?
